1. Capistrano:
  - Опиши всяка машина във въпросния config/deploy/<target>.rb
  - направи един успешен deploy на машините
2. MySQL setup
  - comment out the bind-address and skip-networking lines in /etc/mysql/my.conf
  - restart the mysql daemon
  - open port 3306 (if on amazon or any other cloud config, you may need to allow incoming traffic to it)
  - run the following in the mysql client:
    CREATE USER 'root'@'<remote IP>' IDENTIFIED BY '<root pass>';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'<remote IP>' WITH GRANT OPTION;
3. elasticsearch
  - runs on one of the machines (should be the main one)
  - open up port 9200 for outside connections from the other hosts
  - edit config/initializers/elasticsearch.yml for the desired env
  - edit /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml bind_host to 0.0.0.0
  - sudo service elasticsearch restart
4. additional puma servers
  - bind to a specific port (bind 'tcp://127.0.0.1:9292')
  - open that port to the public (amazon console)
  list those servers in the web server's nginx.conf
5. NOT TESTED!!! - paperclip uploading images should work!





Tips:
* watch out for <! directives in the nginx conf
* careful for the puma config
* careful what your puma environment is
